Mangal gallants rescues her and attempts to take her to her destination, to no avail, as the person she is looking for has moved. The next day, Mangal and the young woman, Mala, again attempt to seek Ratanlal, a music director, but the entire day is spent in vain. Mala lives in Mangal's tiny apartment and both become attracted to each other. When Mala finds out about Sylvie, she leaves him. He goes in her search, but finds that she has become a famous singer with the help of her music director friend. Will Mangal ever get a chance to tell about his love for Mala? What will Sylvie's reaction be?",

When Marvin finally asks Josie on a date, she discovers that Marvin has built a television screen saver that blocks all commercial breaks, live or in rerun. Seeing an opportunity for both of them, Josie suggests that they team together to sell his invention. But first, she must get him fired from the company. Her idea is to have him pretend to sexually harass her. Then, away from the company, and over a reasonable amount of time in a secluded location, he will pretend to invent the apparatus he's already invented. The problem is, in order to steal the invention away from the rightful company, they must lie to the company, lie to his parents, and lie to her friend. In a beautiful lake cabin she rented for their adventure, they await the results of their larceny. Unfortunately, reality catches up with them in more ways than one.",

But he died young, cruelly shunned by the game and by the very people who owed him so much. The story is told by his two wives, his friends and fans, including Pele, Sir Geoff Hurst, Harry Redknapp, Ray Davies, Ray Winstone and Russell Brand, and more than 30 others, whose words are mixed with previously unseen archive footage.",

But in Serbia, people were busy barricading themselves in their homes and shelters for fear of the dark. Filmmaker Natasa Urban returns to the eclipse as motif and metaphor in her paradoxically evocative and thoughtful film about her own upbringing during the war in the former Yugoslavia, to which she travels back in THE ECLIPSE to collect stories and anecdotes from her family and acquaintances. A cotton curtain in the wind on a spring day, a lush forest floor. The war is far away - or is it? Shot on analogue 16mm film with an artist's eye for how traces of the past remain deposited in the present - both physically and mentally - Urban creates a rich, existential work of imagery with a quiet, philosophical weight that is rare and precious. As when her father wanders the lush landscapes while you hear him reading from his journals about the wanderings he took while the war was still going on.",

Unfortunately, as the years pass, the child who dreamt of adventures slowly became caught up in adult life.\n\nAs he enters his thirties, though Florent had built a career and was at the head of a start-up valued at several million euros, a sudden bankruptcy completely turns his life upside down. He decides to take a break and sets off for a bike tour of Iceland.\n\nAfter a month of wandering around the icy terrain, he climbs up the Snaefellsjokull volcano, the very volcano made famous by Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth. It was there, as he followed in the footsteps of Professor Lidenbrock, that he decided that Paris was no longer for him. He wanted to reconnect with his childhood dream, that of becoming an explorer.\n\nThis is the beginning of a flamboyant odyssey during which our young adventurer sets out to discover the most unexplored territories the world has to offer. It is thanks to this story, this life of wandering, that he learns to let go of all that he knew before. Florent speaks of a feeling of freedom washing over him when he connects with this wild nature, encouraging him to leave his old life behind.\n\nBuilt around extraordinary adventures, the film focuses on the spiritual quest of an adult who decides to follow his childhood dreams and takes a look at the realities of our somewhat crazy world which dreams of widespread abundance.\n\nOriginal title : Wanderlust, Le chemin de l'insouciance.",

Traumatized by witnessing the massacre of his comrades, he has taken to drink, and he is ready to exact revenge. His attempts to return to the front, however, are frustrated, when he is assigned a different mission. With a team of soldiers unfit for duty at the front, he is ordered to take a group of fifteen German prisoners and their commanding officer to the remote village of Polumgla to construct a radio tower for use as an airplane beacon. With the ability to communicate only in rudimentary phrases and left to their own devices far away from the war, the villagers, soldiers, and the German prisoners slowly begin to coexist peacefully. The film ends with a detachment of NKVD soldiers arriving and declaring that the war is over, and that the radio tower the German prisoners of war have been working on for a year is no longer of any use. All of the German prisoners of war, many of whom have become intimate with the village women, are marched off into the woods and executed.",

Ali wants to shoot a tiger, but the orangutans Tua and his baby Rango get in the way, and Rango is almost grabbed by the tiger. While Ali prepares a tiger trap, the orangutans enter Ali's hut and feast on the stored goods. Dozens of orangutans join them, ransacking the hut. When Ali and Bin return to discover the havoc, Ali captures Rango and puts him on a chain. Later, Ali saves Tua from a black panther. In the night, a tiger enters the camp, and Rango warns Bin in time for him to shoot and scare the tiger away. At dawn, Tua comes for Rango and eats in the hut, while Bin tends the water buffaloes. After the tiger kills a deer, the orangutans scream warnings to each other and flee. Two male tigers approach and chase Bin, Rango and Tua. The tiger kills Rango, but the water buffalo fights the tiger and kills him.",

Before her arrival, the Latin maid casually enters Jack the father's bed and sleeps with him while his oblivious wife Jeanette is in the very next room talking to him. The rich family is bankrupt and so Jeanette plans to get her son Rick married to the promising actress Brooke. She sets up a dinner but her porn actress daughter Jill is late after the family's handyman complies to practice a scene with her. When she finally arrives, Brooke already left to talk with Jeanette's niece Mark, whose mother Billie also counts on him marrying Brooke. Jeanette, who gives up on the dinner in frustration, tells the handyman to sleep with her or else get fired, only to end up firing him anyway for bad performance. But at night, it is the older Jack with whom Brooke fantasizes about sleeping. Even more so, the following day it is Jill who takes Brooke to a spa's hot tub and hits on her with success. Rick and Mark show up afterward. Brooke seems to like Rick, so Mark heads back in defeat to his mother Billie. His overbearing mother takes advantage of his feelings of defeat with women to sleep with him herself. After Rick's Latin maid teases his sexual inexperience, Rick reveals his suspicion about her having an affair with his father. Nevertheless, he says he likes her and also respects their privacy, so he wouldn't tell her off to his mother. This makes the Latin maid change her mind about his maturity and she sleeps with him too. Later on, he gets more intimate with Brooke and she decides to sleep with him as well. He then comes clean about the plan to marry her. Brooke immediately dumps him and leaves NYC in her limo. She has the driver stop spontaneously for a hitchhiker, who is amazed when she pulls down his pants and lets him find himself on the receiving end of a celebrity blow-job, before she throws him out unceremoniously.",

Alex has a few ideas, like a biopic of Lenny Bruce or a movie about a black uprising in Los Angeles. As he makes the rounds of both the Hollywood community and European movie centers for ideas, he fantasizes about movie scenarios of his everyday situations, influenced by his movie idols, some of whom he actually meets, like Italian director Federico Fellini and French actress Jeanne Moreau. He's also wondering what to do about his personal life: does it make sense for him to \"move up\" with his wife Beth and their two daughters from their middle-class lifestyle? If so, filmmaking must not only achieve his main purpose of saying something meaningful, but also must be commercially successful. But must the need for commercial success ultimately take artistic control out of his hands?",

Petruchio is even more excited at the prospect of marrying this wildcat of a woman after meeting her. Katherine will have none of it, even if it means her sister's spinsterhood, but has no choice but to marry him. Beyond the fact of the marriage itself, Katherine is even more irked by Petruchio's less than conventional behavior at the ceremony and post ceremony bridal feast.

He approaches his friend Antonio the merchant to be his guarantor. However, Antonio's recent ventures have left him short of money. Nevertheless, Antonio accepts Bassanio's request. They meet with the moneylender Shylock, who despises Antonio, due to his discrimination of Jews and his support of the Nazi political party. Shylock agrees to a short-term loan, grasping at an opportunity to exact his revenge upon Antonio and expresses that should the debt not be paid on time, the forfeit will be a pound of Antonio's flesh.

In a bitter struggle of the individual against the collective, three people stand forth with the mark of the unconquered in their bearing: Kira, who wants to be a builder, and the two men who love her - Leo, an aristocrat, and Andrei, a Communist. In their tensely dramatic story, Ayn Rand shows what the theories of Communism mean in practice. We the Living is not a story of politics but of the men and women who have to struggle for existence behind the Red banners and slogans. It is a picture of what dictatorship - of any kind - does to human beings, what kind of men are able to survive, and which of them remain as the ultimate winners. What happens to the defiant ones? What happens to those who succumb? Who are the winners in this conflict? Against a vivid panorama of political revolution and personal revolt, Ayn Rand offers an answer that challenges the modern conscience.",
